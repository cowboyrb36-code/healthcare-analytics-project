📄 Project Overview
Healthcare Analytics Project — SQL + Tableau
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of patient data to uncover insights across clinical outcomes, hospital operations, financial performance, and patient risk. It mirrors the workflow of a real healthcare data analyst working within a hospital system, payer organization, or healthcare analytics team.

The project demonstrates end‑to‑end analytical capability, including:

Data cleaning and standardization

Exploratory data analysis

Clinical, operational, and financial insight generation

KPI development

Predictive risk scoring using SQL

Dashboard design for executive reporting

The goal is to show how structured analytics can support decision‑making in healthcare environments.

Business Context
Healthcare organizations rely on data to:

Improve patient outcomes

Reduce operational bottlenecks

Optimize resource allocation

Identify high‑risk patients

Manage payer relationships

Control costs and improve revenue cycle performance

This project simulates those real‑world needs by analyzing a synthetic dataset containing:

Patient demographics

Medical conditions

Medications

Test results

Length of stay

Admission types

Billing amounts

Insurance providers

Hospitals and doctors

The analysis provides actionable insights that could support clinical leadership, operations teams, and financial managers.

Objectives
This project focuses on answering key questions across four domains:

1. Clinical Quality
Which conditions have the highest abnormal test rates

Which medications correlate with abnormal results

Which hospitals show higher abnormal test patterns

Which conditions lead to longer length of stay

2. Operational Efficiency
Which doctors treat the most patients

Which hospitals handle the highest volume

What admission types are most common

How patient volume varies across providers

3. Financial Performance
Which conditions drive the highest billing

Billing patterns by hospital

Billing patterns by insurance provider

Cost variation across patient groups

4. Predictive Risk
What factors predict patient risk

How to classify patients into Low, Medium, and High risk tiers

How risk correlates with LOS, billing, and outcomes

Methodology Summary
The project follows a structured analytics workflow:

1. Data Cleaning
Standardized fields, validated formats, and created a clean SQL view (healthanalysis.clean_data).

2. Exploratory Analysis
Identified patterns in conditions, medications, test results, and patient demographics.

3. Insight Development
Built clinical, operational, and financial queries to answer business questions.

4. Risk Scoring Model
Developed a SQL‑based risk score using age, admission type, LOS, condition severity, and test results.

5. Dashboard Design
Created a Tableau dashboard with KPIs and visualizations for executive‑level reporting.
